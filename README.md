# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
The program checks whether a text file exists.  
If the file is available, it reads and displays the content line by line.  
If the file does not exist, an error message is shown.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
The program takes user input and writes it to a text file.  
Additional data is appended to the same file.  
Finally, the program reads and displays the complete file content.
